##Car Sales Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a car sales dataset. The project aims to clean, preprocess, and visualize key insights from the data using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and StatsmodelsAPI.

Project Overview

This analysis provides insights into car sales data by:

Cleaning and processing the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
Creating visualizations to understand trends and patterns in car sales.

##Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, transforming data types, and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Using visualizations to highlight trends and distributions in the dataset.
Statistical Modeling: Utilizing basic statistical models with StatsmodelsAPI to explore relationships in the data.
Technologies Used

Python: Programming language used for the analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating data visualizations.
StatsmodelsAPI: For basic statistical modeling.
